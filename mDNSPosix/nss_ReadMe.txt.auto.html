# Readme for libnss_mdns

Andrew White &lt;<a href="mailto:Andrew.White@nicta.com.au">Andrew.White@nicta.com.au</a>&gt;
June 2004

Before using this software, see &quot;Licensing&quot; at bottom of this file.


# Introduction

This code implements a module for the Name Service Switch to perform
hostname lookups using the Darwin mDNSResponder / mdnsd.  This code has
been tested on Debian and Redhat Linux.  It may work on other platforms. 
It *will not* work on Darwin or Mac OS X - the necessary functionality is
already built into the operation system.


# Building and Installing:

See &quot;ReadMe.txt&quot; for instructions on building and installing.

When you run &quot;make install&quot; as described in that file:
o libnss_mdns-0.2.so and libnss_mdns.so.2 are installed in /lib,
o manual pages libnss_mdns(8) and nss_mdns.conf(5) are installed,
o nss_mdns.conf is installed in /etc, and
o /etc/nsswitch.conf is modified to add &quot;mdns&quot; on the &quot;hosts:&quot; line

This will cause dns lookups to be passed via mdnsd before trying the dns.


# Testing

For most purposes, 'ping myhostname.local' will tell you if mdns is
working.  If MDNS_VERBOSE was set in nss_mdns.c during compilation then
lots of chatty debug messages will be dumped to LOG_DEBUG in syslog. 
Otherwise, nss_mdns will only log if something isn't behaving quite right.


# Implementation details

libnss_mdns provides alternative back-end implementations of the libc
functions gethostbyname, gethostbyname2 and gethostbyaddr, using the Name
Service Switch mechanism.  More information on writing nsswitch modules
can be found via 'info libc &quot;Name Service Switch&quot;', if installed.
