.Sh NAME
.Nm libnss_mdns
.Nd name service switch module to support Apple mdnsd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
shared library implements a name service switch module to interface with Apple
mdnsd.  It is enabled by adding
.Ql mdns
to the
.Ql hosts:
line of
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5 .
This will cause calls to
.Xr gethostbyname 3 ,
.Xr gethostbyname2 3
and
.Xr gethostbyaddr 3
to include mdnsd in their lookup path.
.Pp
The
.Nm
shared library should be installed in the system library paths, typically in
.Pa /lib .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /etc/nss_mdns.conf
configuration options
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In
.Pa /etc/nsswitch.conf :
.Dl hosts: files mdns dns
.Pp
This will cause the name service switch to lookup hostnames first using
.Pa /etc/hosts ,
then mdns and finally via DNS.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm
dumps status information via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.\&quot; Cross-references should be ordered by section (low to high), then in
.\&quot;     alphabetical order.
